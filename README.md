# Guard-And-Thief
Two-player hiding-in-plain-sight AI proof of concept.<br/><br/>
The AI museum-goers in this proof-of-concept are meant to move in simple, copyable ways so that the art thief player can copy the AI's mannerisms to hide from the security guard player as one of the museum-goers. The GIF below shows the AI museum-goers wandering the museum and periodically stopping near art pieces, exits, and high-traffic hallways.<br/><br/>
